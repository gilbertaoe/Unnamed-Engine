## Getting Started

If you want to help:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Shoot me a message or email. gilbertaoe@hotmail.com

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Create branches in this format:
    * bug/your-bug
    * feature/your-feature
    * hotfix/your-hotfix
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
